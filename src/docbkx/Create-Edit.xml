        <title>Creating and Editing Concepts</title>
        <para>Concepts, or terminologies, are the defining content of existing terminology systems.
            In order to view, modify, and create new ones, Knowledge provides a simple workflow for
            your local concept needs. This section will provide information on how to edit, create,
            and clone a concept.</para>

            <title>How to Edit a Concept</title>
            <para>If your account has editor permissions, you can edit a concept by viewing its
                concept details, then selecting "Edit" in the upper right corner of the
                viewer.</para>
            <para>In Edit Concept mode, the concept can be activated or inactivated and the
                descriptions and axioms may be modified. In order to save any changes, select the
                "Save" button at the bottom of the viewer.</para>

                    concepts or descriptions. There is a dropdown menu on the page to select the
                    proper status for the terminology. Select the Save button to confirm your

        <para>There are several different types of Assemblages but currently Knowledge has
            implemented Simple Assemblages. A Simple Assemblage is a set of concepts. The set of
            concepts are defined by the user creating the Simple Assemblage. For example, a simple
            Assemblage may be created for values used to record the measurement site of a patients
            heart rate, where the values could be finger, ear lobe, and wrist.</para>

            are two ways to create a new reference set, also referred to as a refset in the
            application: by selecting "Create Refset" under the Authoring navigation menu, and by
            selecting "Newâ€¦" under the Sets tab in the Authoring viewing pane.</para>
        <para>On the Create New Refset page, fill out the information needed and select "Create".
            Once the refset is created, you will see the ability to add concept members on the left

        <section>
                <title>Adding Members to a Refset</title>
        <para>To add members to a refset, select the "Edit Members" button when viewing the refset
                details. This will take you into an edit view where you can find concepts by
                taxonomy, search, or import. Once you have found the concept(s) you want to add,
                select the plus icon next to it and the item will be added to the table on the left
                pane. </para>
        <para>When you are ready to save the members list, select "Compare &amp; Sync" to review
            your changes. If there are any conflicts, the table will display the information to help
            you decide how to sync the new data into the refset.</para>
        <para>On the Compare &amp; Sync page, the "Save Changes" button means that you wish to save
                the changes you just made (as displayed under the <emphasis role="bold"
